# Portfolio Optimization

This software is just a coding test and should not be used for actual portfolio optimization. Always double check your own results. I take no responsability or make any guarantee for this software.

Download all files to the same folder, put index_portfolio (the HTML file) in its own folder called "template".

The goal of the program is to make an optimized allocation when adding new stocks to an existing portfolio.

Start out by adding your existing stock to the two left columns. Then add the new stocks to the last column. Put the total cash amount your stocks will cost in "Value Adding".

If you want a minimum/maximum allocation percentage of the final portfolio you can add that. It might be hard to estimate before any calculations so the possible range is calculate in the table section. So run it one time without any changes and then go back and rerun with a reasonable number.
